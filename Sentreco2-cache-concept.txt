Sentreco 2 Buffering
3/6/14

********************
When input is received, the API will check that user input for existence in the buffer database.
If the input is found then the saved response will be returned.

Else the input will be processed as normal AND the input will be saved to the buffer database.

This will speed up response time for very large questions.
